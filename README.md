# spectrumscale-guides

This repository contains code fragements and presentations that I've used for talks at **Spectrum Scale User Group meetings**. 
Most of the material covers the **Spectrum Scale REST API** and consists of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/ "Jupyter Notebooks"). 
Just pull the folder you are interested in and start your notebook server from within that folder. You may have to edit hostnames, user names and passwords so that the scripts work in your environment.
